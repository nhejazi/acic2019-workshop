# The TMLE Framework

_Jeremy Coyle_

Based on the [`tmle3` `R` package](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3).

Updated: `r Sys.Date()`

## Learning Objectives
1. Use `tmle3` to estimate an Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
2. Understand `tmle3` "Specs"
3. Fit `tmle3` for a custom set of parameters
4. Use the delta method to estimate transformations of parameters

## Easy-Bake Example: `tmle3` for ATE

We'll illustrate the most basic use of TMLE using the WASH Benefits data
introduced earlier and estimating an Average Treatment Effect (ATE).

As a reminder, the ATE is identified with the following statistical parameter
(under assumptions): $ATE = \mathbb{E}_0(Y(1)-Y(0)) =
\mathbb{E}_0\left(\mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A=1,W]-\mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A=0,W] \right)$

This Easy-Bake implementation consists of the following steps:

0. Load the necessary libraries and data
1. Define the variable roles
2. Create a "Spec" object
3. Define the super learners
4. Fit the TMLE
5. Evaluate the TMLE estimates

### 0. Load the Data {-}

We'll use the same WASH Benefits data as the earlier chapters:

```{r tmle3-load-data}
library(data.table)
library(tmle3)
library(sl3)
washb_data <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/wash-benefits/washb_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

### 1. Define the variable roles {-}

We'll use the common $W$ (covariates), $A$ (treatment/intervention), $Y$
(outcome) data structure. `tmle3` needs to know what variables in the dataset
correspond to each of these roles. We use a list of character vectors to tell
it. We call this a **"Node List"** as it corresponds to the nodes in a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG), a way of displaying causal relationships between variables.

```{r tmle3-node-list}
node_list <- list(
  W = c(
    "month", "aged", "sex", "momage", "momedu",
    "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin",
    "elec", "floor", "walls", "roof", "asset_wardrobe",
    "asset_table", "asset_chair", "asset_khat",
    "asset_chouki", "asset_tv", "asset_refrig",
    "asset_bike", "asset_moto", "asset_sewmach",
    "asset_mobile"
  ),
  A = "tr",
  Y = "whz"
)
```

#### Handling Missingness {-}

Currently, missingness in `tmle3` is handled in a fairly simple way:

* Missing covariates are median (for continuous) or mode (for discrete)
  imputed, and additional covariates indicating imputation are generated
* Observations missing either treatment or outcome variables are excluded.

We plan to implement IPCW-TMLE to more efficiently handle missingness in the
treatment and outcome variables.

These steps are implemented in the `process_missing` function in `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-process_missing}
processed <- process_missing(washb_data, node_list)
washb_data <- processed$data
node_list <- processed$node_list
```

### 2. Create a "Spec" Object {-}

`tmle3` is general, and allows most components of the TMLE procedure to be
specified in a modular way. However, most end-users will not be interested in
manually specifying all of these components. Therefore, `tmle3` implements a
`tmle3_Spec` object that bundles a set of components into a **specification**
that, with minimal additional detail, can be run by an end-user.

We'll start with using one of the specs, and then work our way down into the
internals of `tmle3`.

```{r tmle3-ate-spec}
ate_spec <- tmle_ATE(
  treatment_level = "Nutrition + WSH",
  control_level = "Control"
)
```

### 3. Define the Relevant Super Learners {-}

Currently, the only other thing a user must define are the `sl3` learners used
to estimate the relevant factors of the likelihood: Q and g.

This takes the form of a list of `sl3` learners, one for each likelihood factor
to be estimated with `sl3`:

```{r tmle3-learner-list}
# choose base learners
lrnr_mean <- make_learner(Lrnr_mean)
lrnr_xgboost <- make_learner(Lrnr_xgboost)

# define metalearners appropriate to data types
ls_metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls)
mn_metalearner <- make_learner(
  Lrnr_solnp, metalearner_linear_multinomial,
  loss_loglik_multinomial
)
sl_Y <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost),
  metalearner = ls_metalearner
)
sl_A <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost),
  metalearner = mn_metalearner
)

learner_list <- list(A = sl_A, Y = sl_Y)
```

Here, we use a Super Learner as defined in the previous `sl3` section. In the
future, we plan to include reasonable default learners.

### 4. Fit the TMLE {-}

We now have everything we need to fit the tmle using `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-spec-fit}
tmle_fit <- tmle3(ate_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list)
```

### 5. Evaluate the Estimates {-}

We can see the summary results by printing the fit object. Alternatively, we
can extra results from the summary by indexing into it:

```{r tmle3-spec-summary}
print(tmle_fit)

estimates <- tmle_fit$summary$psi_transformed
print(estimates)
```

## `tmle3` Components

Now that we've successfully used a spec to obtain a TML estimate, let's look
under the hood at the components. The spec has a number of functions that
generate the objects necessary to define and fit a TMLE.

### `tmle3_task`

First is, a `tmle3_Task`, analogous to an `sl3_Task`, containing the data we're
fitting the TMLE to, as well as an NPSEM generated from the `node_list` defined
above, describing the variables and their relationships.

```{r tmle3-spec-task}
tmle_task <- ate_spec$make_tmle_task(washb_data, node_list)
```

```{r tmle3-spec-task-npsem}
tmle_task$npsem
```

### Initial Likelihood

Next, is an object representing the likelihood, factorized according to the
NPSEM described above:

```{r tmle3-spec-initial-likelihood}
initial_likelihood <- ate_spec$make_initial_likelihood(
  tmle_task,
  learner_list
)
print(initial_likelihood)
```

These components of the likelihood indicate how the factors were estimated: the
marginal distribution of $W$ was estimated using NP-MLE, and the conditional
distributions of $A$ and $Y$ were estimated using `sl3` fits (as defined with
the `learner_list`) above.

We can use this in tandem with the `tmle_task` object to obtain likelihood
estimates for each observation:
```{r tmle3-spec-initial-likelihood-estimates}
initial_likelihood$get_likelihoods(tmle_task)
```

<!-- TODO: make helper to get learners out of fit objects -->

### Targeted Likelihood (updater)

We also need to define a "Targeted Likelihood" object. This is a special type
of likelihood that is able to be updated using an `tmle3_Update` object. This
object defines the update strategy (e.g. submodel, loss function, CV-TMLE or
not, etc).

```{r tmle3-spec-targeted-likelihood}
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
```

When constructing the targeted likelihood, you can specify different update
options. See the documentation for `tmle3_Update` for details of the different
options. For example, you can disable CV-TMLE (the default in `tmle3`) as
follows:

```{r tmle3-spec-targeted-likelihood-no-cv}
targeted_likelihood_no_cv <-
  Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood,
    updater = list(cvtmle = FALSE)
  )
```

### Parameter Mapping

Finally, we need to define the parameters of interest. Here, the spec defines a
single parameter, the ATE. In the next section, we'll see how to add additional
parameters.

```{r tmle3-spec-params}
tmle_params <- ate_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(tmle_params)
```

### Putting it all together

Having used the spec to manually generate all these components, we can now
manually fit a `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-manual-fit}
tmle_fit_manual <- fit_tmle3(
  tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, tmle_params,
  targeted_likelihood$updater
)
print(tmle_fit_manual)
```

The result is equivalent to fitting using the `tmle3` function as above.

## Fitting `tmle3` with multiple parameters

Above, we fit a `tmle3` with just one parameter. `tmle3` also supports fitting
multiple parameters simultaneously. To illustrate this, we'll use the
`tmle_TSM_all` spec:

```{r tmle3-tsm-all}
tsm_spec <- tmle_TSM_all()
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
all_tsm_params <- tsm_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(all_tsm_params)
```

This spec generates a Treatment Specific Mean (TSM) for each level of the
exposure variable. Note that we must first generate a new targeted likelihood,
as the old one was targeted to the ATE. However, we can recycle the initial
likelihood we fit above, saving us a super learner step.

### Delta Method

We can also define parameters based on Delta Method Transformations of other
parameters. For instance, we can estimate a ATE using the delta method and two
of the above TSM parameters:

```{r tmle3-delta-method-param}
ate_param <- define_param(
  Param_delta, targeted_likelihood,
  delta_param_ATE,
  list(all_tsm_params[[1]], all_tsm_params[[4]])
)
print(ate_param)
```

This can similarly be used to estimate other derived parameters like Relative
Risks, and Population Attributable Risks

### Fit

We can now fit a TMLE simultaneously for all TSM parameters, as well as the
above defined ATE parameter

```{r tmle3-tsm-plus-delta}
all_params <- c(all_tsm_params, ate_param)

tmle_fit_multiparam <- fit_tmle3(
  tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, all_params,
  targeted_likelihood$updater
)

print(tmle_fit_multiparam)
```

## Exercise

Follow the steps below to estimate an average treatment effect using data from
the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), available in the `sl3` package. To simplify this example, we define a binary intervention variable, `parity01`
-- an indicator of having one or more children before the current child and a
binary outcome, `haz01` -- an indicator of having an above average height for
age.

<!--
We're interested in using this simplified data to estimate an Average Treatment
Effect (ATE):

$$\Psi(P_0) = E_0(E_0[Y|A=1,W]-E_0[Y|A=0,W])$$

The purely statistical (noncausal) parameter can be interpreted as the average
of the difference in means across the strata for $W$, and only requires the
positivity assumption, that the conditional treatment assignment probabilities
are positive for each possible $w:P_0(A=1|W =w)>0$ and $P_0(A=0|W =w)>0$ for
each possible $w$.

To interpret this parameter as causal, specifically the causal risk difference
$E_0Y_1-E_0Y_0$, then we would also need to make the randomization assumption
stating that $A$ is independent of the counterfactuals $(Y_0,Y_1)$ within
strata of $W$. This assumption might have been included in the original SCM
$\mathcal{M}^F$, but, if one knows there are unmeasured confounders, then the
model $\mathcal{M}^{F\*}$ would be more restrictive by enforcing this "known
to be wrong" randomization assumption. Still, this assumption does not change
the statistical model $\mathcal{M}$, and as a consequence, it does not affect
the estimation problem either. Thus, the theorem's that establish desirable
properties of the TMLE, still hold even when this non-testable randomization
assumption is violated.

We proceed with implementing a targeted minimum loss-based estimator (TMLE),
an efficient substitution estimator which is not only asymptotically
consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, and asymptotically efficient,
but also tailored to have robust finite sample performance.

1. Define the variable roles $(W,A,Y)$ by creating a list of these nodes.
   Include the following baseline covariates in $W$: `apgar1`, `apgar5`,
   `gagebrth`, `mage`, `meducyrs`, `sexn`. Both $A$ and $Y$ are specified
   above.
2. Define a `tmle3_Spec` object for the ATE, `tmle_ATE()`.
3. Using the same base learning libraries defined above, specify `sl3` base
   learners for estimation of $Q = E(Y|A,Y)$ and $g=P(A|W)$.
4. Define the metalearner like below

```{r, metalrnr-exercise}
metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_solnp,
                            loss_function = loss_loglik_binomial,
                            learner_function = metalearner_logistic_binomial)
```   

5. Define one super learner for estimating $Q$ and another for estimating $g$.
   Use the metalearner above for both $Q$ and $g$ super learners.
6. Create a list of the two super learners defined in Step 5 and call this
   object `learner_list`. The list names should be `A` (defining the super
   learner for estimating $g$) and `Y` (defining the super learner for
   estimating $Q$).
7. Fit the tmle with the `tmle3` function by specifying (1) the `tmle3_Spec`,
   which we defined in Step 2; (2) the data; (3) the list of nodes, which we
   specified in Step 1; and (4) the list of super learners for estimating $g$
   and $Q$, which we defined in Step 6. *Note*: Like before, you will need to
   make a data copy to deal with `data.table` weirdness (`cpp2 <- data.table::copy(cpp)`) and use `cpp2` as the data.

## Summary

`tmle3` is a general purpose framework for generating TML estimates. The
easiest way to use it is to use a predefined spec, allowing you to just fill in
the blanks for the data, variable roles, and `sl3` learners. However, digging
under the hood allows users to specify a wide range of TMLEs. In the next
sections, we'll see how this framework can be used to estimate advanced
parameters such as optimal treatments and shift interventions.
